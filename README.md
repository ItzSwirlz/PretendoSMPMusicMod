# PretendoSMPMusicMod
Trying to add music to the Pretendo Survival SMP

This is just an experiment for now!

The Pretendo Survival SMP in Minecraft has regions of the world named after specific things Wii U/3DS/Nintendo related. Examples being Wara Wara Plaza (referring to the Wii U System Menu) and StreetPass Mii Plaza (An application on the Nintendo 3DS).

The goal of this mod is to add the sounds of these places into the world - playing the music when you are on the server and in the specific area.
